      "Program Description": "Many of the careers in sport management, particularly those in intercollegiate athletics and sport analytics, require a master’s degree.  A master’s in sport management with an option of an Intercollegiate Athletic Management or Sport Analytics concentration will fill a current gap in educational offerings for students pursuing advanced degrees in the discipline. The interdisciplinary nature of sport management makes it possible to support students from multiple academic backgrounds who wish to advance their careers in the sport industry. The program would support students who achieved an undergraduate degree in sport management that want to further their education beyond the general curriculum and pursue a specific focus more relevant to their sector of sport.  Likewise, the program would support students who do not have an undergraduate degree in sport management but are looking to extend their knowledge to advance their careers in the sport industry.\r\n\r\nWhile the program prepares students to serve in a variety of sectors, the program focuses specifically on two emerging areas in the discipline: Intercollegiate Athletics Administration and Sport Analytics. The program consists of seven foundational courses that cover numerous aspects critical for the administration of sport programs. Students will also select four electives with an option to take the courses in a concentration or combine electives across concentrations. The concentration in Intercollegiate Athletic Administration focuses on sport administration in a higher education context. The Sport Analytics concentration prepares students to apply data science to problems facing sport organizations. The academic experience will culminate with a comprehensive exam and a three credit experiential learning course.",

      "Program Description": "The Bachelor of Science in Liberal Studies program allows students to create an individualized curriculum composed of courses and experiences which meet their individual career needs. This program was designed with the following students in mind:\r\n\r\n- Non-traditional or adult students who are already in the workplace, but need a baccalaureate degree to advance in their current career. Consultation with employers or supervisors will help students identify career needs which will form the basis for the design of an individualized curriculum; and\r\n\r\n- Traditional students with clear academic or career goals who are open to and interested in novel ways of organizing an undergraduate experience which draws on the multiple resources of current distance learning opportunities, courses available through other institutions within the Atlanta Regional Consortium of Higher Education (ARCHE), and opportunities for internships and work/study experiences available in the larger community\r\n\r\nThis approach is different from many traditional, discipline-based baccalaureate programs which are designed in part to prepare students for advanced work in a specific academic discipline -- a major in history or biology, for example. This flexibility enables students to develop academic plans that meet the ever-changing requirements of the world of work, but it also requires careful planning. Students should clarify their career or learning goals as they begin designing the components of their program. The bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies can also be an appropriate preparation for students planning to attend graduate school in certain disciplines and professions. Students may earn either a baccalaureate degree by completing a planned program of 120 semester credit hours or an associate's degree with a major in Liberal Studies upon the completion of Areas A-F of the Core Curriculum.",

      "Program Description": "The Integrative Studies program allows students to create an individualized curriculum composed of courses and experiences, which meet their individual career needs. This approach is different from many traditional, discipline-based baccalaureate programs which are designed in part to prepare students for advanced work in a specific academic discipline — a major in history or biology, for example. This flexibility enables students to develop academic plans that meet the ever-changing requirements of the world of work. But, it also requires careful planning. Students should clarify their career or learning goals as they begin designing the components of their program. The bachelor’s degree in Integrative Studies offers preparation for students planning to attend graduate school in many disciplines and professions. Students may earn either a baccalaureate degree by completing a planned program of 120 semester credit hours or an associate's degree upon the completion of Areas A-F of the Core Curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe program provides students with the opportunity to bring together— or to integrate — courses from a wide variety of academic areas or disciplines to support their individual goals. Students completing the degree have the opportunity to craft their own individualized program of study. Furthermore, students with specific career and academic goals have the opportunity to choose courses from various disciplines.",

      "Program Name": "Bachelor of Science with a Major in Psychology and Human Services",
      "Program Description": "Clayton State’s baccalaureate (BS) program in Psychology and Human Services is firmly grounded in the discipline of psychology while at the same time stressing realistic career opportunities in human services fields for the bachelor’s degree graduate. The curriculum design allows students to integrate the disciplines of psychology, sociology, social services, youth services, health care, nonprofit management, multicultural studies, education, and business, into an academic and experiential program that will prepare graduates for vocations in diverse areas of the helping professions. The curriculum capitalizes on Clayton State University’s information technology expertise to insure that students will graduate with highly marketable computer skills in database management, electronic forms, and other software applications appropriate to the field.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive nature of Clayton State’s Psychology and Human Services program is its clear focus on employment for the technologically competent baccalaureate graduate. Existing psychology programs tend to have a primary focus on the traditional pattern of preparing students for graduate school. For those programs, preparation for entry-level careers is an acknowledged but secondary concern. Consistent with its mission, Clayton State University’s new program reverses these more typical priorities by emphasizing entry-level professional opportunities in human services fields as the focus of the program.\r\n\r\nThough the Clayton State University program's focus is on human services, graduates will find career opportunities in many fields. Expected placements include local, state, national, and international public and private nonprofit social service agencies, facilities, and organizations including youth service organizations, drug treatment centers, penal institutions, halfway houses, and senior centers. Some potential occupations for the B.S. graduate include: caseworker, therapist, intake administrator, rehabilitation counselor, probation counselor, youth guidance staff, organizational administrator, and fund raiser. The degree will also prepare students for graduate work in psychology, community counseling, social work, and related fields. (Even though immediate employment will constitute the primary tone of the major, psychology department heads at several other institutions have reviewed our tentative curriculum and confirmed that it would provide an adequate foundation for advanced study at their universities.)",
